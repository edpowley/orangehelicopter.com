	<description>
	A modern twist on classic bubble popping gameplay!
	Shoot the blobs to match 3 of the same colour and pop them. Blobjam has realistic physics, so aim carefully -- those blobs have a habit of squidging around in ways you don't expect.

	<history>
	Blobjam is Orange Helicopter's first game.
	What started out as a happy childhood memory of Puzzle Bobble, an experiment with OpenGL shaders and a desire to use Box2D physics for something eventually transformed into a full game.
	It's called Blobjam because I had toast and jam for breakfast that morning, and Blobtoast would be a stupid name.
