	<description>
	&lt;b&gt;SpaceCaves&lt;/b&gt; is a retro-styled 2D twin-stick shooter with elements from stealth games, roguelikes and RPGs.
	</description>
	
	<history>
	I used to be an AI researcher, and one of the projects I worked on was the &lt;a href="http://www.ptsp-game.net/"&gt;Physical Travelling Salesman Problem&lt;/a&gt;,
	where the aim is to pilot an Asteroids-like spaceship around a maze as quickly as possible.
	But then I came to think: What if you could just blast your way through the walls of the maze?
	And what if the mazes were randomly generated?
	And what if there were enemies trying to kill you as well, but you had the option of out-stealthing them?
	And why, when every other indie game boasts of "retro-styled graphics", doesn't the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex"&gt;Vectrex&lt;/a&gt; get any love?
	SpaceCaves is my answer to all of these questions and more.
